# Polymorphism
This code is an example of object-oriented programming in C++, and demonstrates the use of inheritance, polymorphism, smart pointers, and dynamic memory allocation. 
The code defines a set of classes to model different geometric shapes, such as squares, rectangles, triangles, and circles. Each shape class inherits from a base class called "Shape." 
The code also includes a main function that allows the user to input a shape's details and calculates and display its area and perimeter.
